Instead of relying on local infrastructure, users can access and use these resources on-demand from remote data centers. Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, cost efficiency, and the ability to access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.",

An exploit, on the other hand, is a piece of software or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability to carry out malicious actions. Exploits leverage vulnerabilities to launch attacks, such as gaining unauthorized access, executing arbitrary code, or causing system crashes.\r\n\r\nAm i right?",
